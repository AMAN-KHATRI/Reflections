When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repositories come very handy when we can't access our computer at any place and we want to make some changes in code, then we can 
  use remote repositories that can be accessed from anywhere anytime. Remote repositories also come handy when two are more peoples are 
  working on a same respository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because if in case we are working on a modification for any application and we don't want the changes to be pulled that's why we use mannual pull.
