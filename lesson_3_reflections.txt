When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repositories come very handy when we can't access our computer at any place and we want to make some changes in code, then we can 
  use remote repositories that can be accessed from anywhere anytime. Remote repositories also come handy when two are more peoples are 
  working on a same respository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because if in case we are working on a modification for any application and we don't want the changes to be pulled that's why we use mannual pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork means to copy any other repository from github into your own account for making changes. 
	Clone means to make a copy of repository present on github into your own local machine.
	Branches are just made for testing different features for an application, once successful they can be merged with master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It helps us to check the commit status which is on github to one in our local machine.
