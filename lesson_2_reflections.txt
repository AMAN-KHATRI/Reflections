What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	when we initialixe a repository a repository named .gir is created which is a hidden directory which tracks all the changes made in the file. We need to do it to make a git respository and track it's changes with the help of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is the area for the files which are to be commited.
